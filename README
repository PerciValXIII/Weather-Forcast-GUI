This a mini project where I use python library Tkinter to develop a simple GUI( Graphical user Interface) for a weather forecast app.
This app lets the user enter any city Name and click the button to get the current weather forecast of that city which is displayed on the screen.
The GUI is connected to an online weather forecast API.
